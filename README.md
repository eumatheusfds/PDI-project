# Final project for the Digital Image Processing course.
The project aims to analyze the evolution and changes in vegetation cover in João Pessoa, the capital of the state of Paraíba, Brazil, over a period of time. The city of João Pessoa is known for its natural beauty, with vast green areas and a rich diversity of ecosystems.

Analyzing the green areas over the years is of utmost importance to understand the impact of environmental changes, urbanization, and city development on natural resources. A geospatial data-based approach and remote sensing techniques will be used to obtain detailed information about vegetation cover and its temporal variation. To achieve this, we will use NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) and the Python language.
